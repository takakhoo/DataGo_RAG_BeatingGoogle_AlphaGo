#context: We are using a TRAINED katago model.
The only thing we are training is the RAG parameters. ~~> Question: Will training by including 
RAG + MCTS deep search during self play be fast enough? Or if we augmented the RAG offline,

2. For positions we have high uncertainty about, due to either A: lack of sufficient training data
on that game state, or B: many good options so high difficulty in distinguishing the true "best" winning move,
we would like to store these. The RAG will compute high uncertainty based on a function of two weights 
(which we know are for certain indicators of uncertainty, and do not risk overfitting): 1. High policy cross-entropy, defined as E. 
2. High value distribution - when katago calculates the value estimates for each position and updates them after 
backpropogation, after finishing the MCTS search, stores all the updated values for every searched game state.
These values are summed and compared, and function K of value / total measures distribution. Values with sparse distribution
are assigned a high value for K.

3. weights are assigned to E and K, and a total function (w1*E + w2*K)*phase <where phase is a function of how many pieces are left on the board to determine sparseness 
to correlate to late / early game> is learned via play against the baseline
katago to determine the best thresholds for these parameters. This cutoff will then be used to determine the storage threshold for what 
game states go into the RAG and what doesn't go into the RAG, as well as when to look at the RAG.

#playing with RAG - retrieving & updating the RAG in real-time
4. The game will then start. When the model runs into a complex game state in MCTS search (any node) with high uncertainty, the model
will do a 1-Nearest Neighbors search through the RAG database first to see if the complex position has already been stored in the RAG.
However, to ensure forever recursion doesn't occur, forcing MCTS over and over, only allow a complex-node depth of N (hand-tuned parameter / 2nd stage tuning / 
based on our real-world limitations).
However, let's assume at first the position wasn't found (i.e., positions  that showed up in the original MCTS tree). 
We will do a deep level MCTS search (that looks for convergence) to more accurately determine value and policy than the baseline model. The theory for this is that
a deeper level MCTS will always yield better results than a shallow MCTS search. IF the deeper level does not converge after N tree depth, it will stop searching.
It will store these updated results in the form of storing a dict:
{Game Hash: 
 (2 best moves based on value from here, the actual policy function at this snapshot of the game state, the actual value function at this snapshot of the game,
the policy distribution + the list of child nodes that the policy is assigned to, and the info we pulled in step 1.) }

When the model runs into this exact same complex position again, when it does the ANN, it will find this position amongst the RAG database.
To compare value similarity and policy similarity, we first compare how many child node hashes overlap.
Then for each game state node comparison, we calculate the overlap between the children; for each overlapping child,
we compare its policy function (val of a vector) and value (val) at that child's assigned vector dimensional position (to clarify:
since the policy vector matches with the list of children in its feasible reach, so the policy means nothing unless its assigned to the same child).


5. Upon finding this position, it will do a relevancy comparison (threshold 90% - hand tune after fixing the weights) by comparing 
the other features of the vector with the current complex state vector. The comparison weights of the various features will also be learned.
If relevance is high, directly blend that stored policy and value function into the current. Otherwise,
if the relevance is not high, force the best children moves stored in the RAG to be pathways to explore in MCTS; 
either add them at the end of the RAG as a separate MCTS search, or depending on how BFS/DFS dynamic works with MCTS, force them as 
first search.

6. The RAG will populated in ONE WAY: online (in game) // offline implementation is in rag_store/game_analyzer, but method is OBSELETE.
For offline, the process is as follows:
Self-play (fast, 800 visits):
    -Collect all MCTS tree data : child node hashes, values, policies
    -Calculate E (policy entropy) and K (value variance) per position
    -Flag positions where (w1*E + w2*K) * phase > threshold
        -Run deep MCTS (10,000+ visits) on each complex position
        -Get refined: winrate, entropy, score_lead, ownership, moveInfos
    -Write to JSON after each game
Training games against baseline:
    -Query RAG by sym_hash
    -If found with high relevance (>90%): Blend stored policy/value into MCTS
    -If NOT found or low relevance: Force best 2 moves from closest RAG entry as exploration priority (NO deep search mid-game)
Parameter iteration:
    -Play games, measure win rate
    -Adjust w1/w2/phase/relevancy_weights
    -Re-filter same positions with new parameters (no re-analysis!)
    -Repeat until optimal
